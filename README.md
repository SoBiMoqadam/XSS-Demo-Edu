** Hands-On Hacking Lab:** Safely explore **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** attacks on localhost with this educational project.

---

##  Important Warnings

*  Do **NOT** run on real websites
*  Only run on **localhost** (`127.0.0.1`)
*  Vulnerable mode is unsafe, use **only for learning**
*  Secure mode is safe and recommended

##  Learning Outcomes

* ðŸ”¹ Learn **types of XSS**: Stored, Reflected, DOM-based
* ðŸ”¹ Understand how **unsanitized user input** can be exploited
* ðŸ”¹ Compare **vulnerable** vs **safe** behavior
* ðŸ”¹ Practice **secure coding** for web applications
* ðŸ”¹ Build a **hacker mindset safely**

---

##  Goal

Provide a **safe hacking lab** to test XSS attacks and learn secure coding practices.
