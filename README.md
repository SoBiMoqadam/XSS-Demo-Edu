**Educational project to demonstrate Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks safely on localhost.**

---

## Important Warnings

 Do **NOT** use on real websites
 Only run on **localhost** (`127.0.0.1`)
 Vulnerable mode is unsafe, use only for learning
 Secure mode is safe and recommended

##  Learning Outcomes

* Learn **types of XSS**: Stored, Reflected, DOM-based
* Understand how **unsanitized user input** can be exploited
* Compare **vulnerable** vs **safe** behavior
* Practice **secure coding** for web applications

---

##  Goal

Provide a **safe environment** to test XSS attacks and learn secure coding practices.
